All registered attendees of VisWeek are encouraged to attend the workshop. In order to present a paper or poster, it is necessary to have your paper accepted.

Paper Types
-----------
**Note this is redundant right now**

We will accept papers focused on two primary topics in sports data visualization:

1. Techniques and tools for presenting or storytelling with sports data.
2. Tools for exploring sports data.

Papers can be up to four pages long, with the length of the submission corresponding to the technique's contribution. All papers will be peer-reviewed by the workshop organizers.

We are soliciting papers and presentations covering two primary topics related to sports data visualization: (1) techniques and tools for presentation/storytelling with data, and (2) tools for exploring data. Work should focus on topics specific to the use of visualization on sports data, rather than general tools or techniques with only a tangential connection to sports data.
