All registered attendees of [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org) are encouraged to attend the workshop. In order to present a paper, it is necessary to have your paper accepted.

Papers
------
We are soliciting papers and presentations covering topics across the visualization spectrum, including visualization design, presentation and storytelling techniques and tools, and more traditional infovis tools for exploration. Work should focus on topics specific to the use of visualization on sports data, rather than general tools or techniques with only a tangential connection to sports data.

Specific topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Design ideas and representations for sports data visualizations,
* Visual methods for storytelling with sports data,
* Exploration and discovery within sports data,
* Data and visual analytics techniques for sports data,
* Visualization designs for specific sports domains,
* Visualization designs for specific target audiences (e.g. officials, team managers, or the general public),
* Tools and techniques for visual representation or exploration of data for a single game,
* Tools and techniques for visual representation or exploration of data for multiple games or matches,
* Evaluation methodologies and guidelines.

Submission guidelines
---------------------
Submissions for **papers** can be up to eight pages long, with the length of the submission corresponding to the technique's contribution. Submissions for **posters** and **demonstrations** can be up to two pages long. All submissions will be peer-reviewed by the workshop organizers.
