Few areas involve, generate, and celebrate data in the manner that sports does. The field of sports analytics is primarily associated with baseball, but has more recently spread to other sports, including basketball, soccer, professional football, ice hockey, tennis, and golf. Surprisingly, there have been few applications of visualization presentation and exploration tools to sports data. This workshop will serve as the first meeting of researchers and practitioners interested in presenting sports data through visualization. It will provide an opportunity for those engaged in this topic to interact and share their experiences. Hopefully, it will spur growth in a new sub-area of data visualization for the future.
